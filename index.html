        <h3>Assessment and Course Developer - <small>January 2020 - Present</small></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Assessment Development:</strong>As an assessment developer, I am responsible for the development of School Based Assessments (SBAs; all tasks including assignments, investigations, practical assessment tasks, tests and examinations) aligned with the CAPS curriculum for the following subjects:</li>

                <li>Natural Science (Grade 8-9)</li>
                <li>Technology (Grade 8-9)</li>

            </ul>
            <li><strong>Course Development:</strong> As a course developer, I am responsible for the above subjects as a Subject Specialist on the Moore House Academy Learner Management System (LMS). My duties include developing additional content such as quizzes, PowerPoint presentations and videos in which the CAPS curriculum is covered.</li>
            <li><strong>Tutoring:</strong> As a tutor, I explain course content to students online or one-on-one. In my diverse role, I have tutored students in all of the above subjects including, but not limited to:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>English Home Language (Grade 8-12)</li>

            <li><strong>Marking:</strong> As a marker, I have revised scripts from students and provided feedback to ensure improved performance from students in the future.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Pre- and Post-Moderation:</strong> Collaborated with fellow assessment developers to pre-moderate their SBAs, which involves identifying whether the SBA is aligned with the correct curriculum, checking for errors and approving the SBA. During post-moderation, assessment developers and markers collaborate to moderate marked scripts, ensuring that markers have correctly marked the SBAs in accordance with SBA guidelines/ memoranda, and provided feedback to students.</li>
